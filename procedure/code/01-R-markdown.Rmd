# Abstract

Chakraborty (2021) uses early COVID-19 Data to measure if counties with higher rates of disabilities are more prone to effects from the pandemic in terms of infection rates. The overall goal of the study is to investigate whether disabled people are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

In order to measure this, Chakraborty tests the correlation of disability among people over 18, separated by race, poverty, age, sex, with rates of COVID-19 by county. These correlation values are tested for significant outcomes to determind what factors of population demographics can be used to predict a county's COVID-19 rate.

Chakraborty also controls for spatial correlation by using clustering in a General Estimating Equation using both state boundaries and rates of COVID-19. For each category in race, sex, poverty status, and age, a separate GEE model was ran.

Chakraborty found significant positive relationships between rates of disability among traditionally marginalized groups and rates of COVID-19. This study aims to reproduce the results found in Chakraborty's research, using the same models and data sources.

This reproduction study will include: a map of COVID-19 rates by county (fig. 1), a map of disability rates by county (fig. 2), a table of correlation values (fig. 3), a map of GEE clusters (fig. 4), a qualitative map for risk level (fig. 5), and a table of correlation after controlling for spatial dependence (fig. 6).

The reproduction study data and code are available in public a GitHub repository at [https://github.com/jorredahl/RPr-Chakraborty-2021](https://github.com/jorredahl/RPr-Chakraborty2021) and the analysis plans and reports are registered with OSF at <https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S5MTQ>.
The reproduction is implemented with R markdown using the `SpatialEpi` package for the Kulldorff spatial scan statistic packages and the `geepack` package for the generalized estimating equation.

# Study design

The aim of this reproduction study is to implement the original study as closely as possible to reproduce the map of county level distribution of COVID-19 incidence rate, the summary statistics and bivariate correlation for disability characteristics and COVID-19 incidence, and the generalized estimating equations.
Our two confirmatory hypotheses are that we will be able to exactly reproduce Chakraborty's results as presented in table 1 and table 2.
Stated as null reproduction study hypotheses (RPr-H):

> RPr-H1: There is a less than perfect match between Chakraborty's bivariate correlation coefficient for each disability/sociodemographic variable and COVID-19 incidence rate and our bivariate correlation coefficient for each disability/sociodemographic variable and COVID-19 incidence rate.

> RPr-H2: There is a less than perfect match between Chakraborty's beta coefficient for the GEE of each disability/sociodemographic variable and our beta coefficient for the GEE of each disability/sociodemographic variable.

Each hypothesis encompasses multiple models, testing across the demographic variables: race, ethnicity, sex, age, and poverty status.

# Original study design

The original study is **observational**, with the **exploratory** objective of determining "whether COVID-19 incidence is significantly greater in counties containing higher percentages of socio-demographically disadvantaged [people with disabilities], based on their race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and biological sex" (Chakraborty 2021).

In the original study, 18 implicit bivariate hypotheses are tested for correlation between COVID-19 cumulative incidence rates and specific categories of PwDs at the county level.
Although the original publication does not state null hypotheses for each bivariate correlation, we may formulate the original research hypotheses (OR-H) as follows:

> OR-H1.1: There is no correlation between the COVID-19 incidence rate and the percentage of people with disabilities at the county level.
> OR-H1.2: There is no correlation between the COVID-19 incidence rate and the percentage of white people with disabilities at the county level.
> ... OR-H1.18 There is no correlation between the COVID-19 incidence rate and the percentage of female people with disabilities at the county level.

Five multi-variate hypotheses are tested for associations between COVID-19 cumulative incidence rates and subgroups of PwDs at the county level.
Although the original publication does not state null hypotheses for each model, we may formulate them as follows:

> OR-H2.1: The percentages of people with disability, categorized by race, are not associated with COVID-19 incidence at the county level when accounting for the state and risk level of COVID-19 clusters.
> ... OR-H2.5: The percentages of people with disability, categorized by gender, are not associated with COVID-19 incidence at the county level when accounting for the state and risk level of COVID-19 clusters.

There is no **randomization** in the original study.

# Materials and procedure

## Computational environment

The study was originally conducted using SaTScan software to implement the Kulldorff spatial scan statistic.
Other software are not specified in the publication; however data files suggest and communication with the author verifies that spatial analysis and mapping was conducted in ArcGIS, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were calculated in SPSS, and the SaTScan software version was `9.6`.

This reproduction study uses R, including the SpatialEpi package for the Kulldorff spatial scan statistics and the geepack package for GEE models.

```{r environment-setup, include = FALSE}
# record all the packages you are using here
# this includes any calls to library(), require(),
# and double colons such as here::i_am()
packages <- c("tidycensus", "tidyverse", "downloader", "sf", "classInt", "readr",
  "here", "s2", "pastecs", "tmap", "SpatialEpi", "svDialogs",
  "geepack", "knitr", "kableExtra", "foreign", "broom", "dotwhisker", "dotenv")

# force all conflicts to become errors
# if you load dplyr and use filter(), R has to guess whether you mean dplyr::filter() or stats::filter()
# the conflicted package forces you to be explicit about this
# disable at your own peril
# https://conflicted.r-lib.org/
require(conflicted)

# load and install required packages
# https://groundhogr.com/
if (!require(groundhog)) {
  install.packages("groundhog")
  require(groundhog)
}

# this date will be used to determine the versions of R and your packages
# it is best practice to keep R and its packages up to date
groundhog.day <- "2025-03-08"

# this replaces any library() or require() calls
groundhog.library(packages, groundhog.day)
# you may need to install a correct version of R
# you may need to respond OK in the console to permit groundhog to install packages
# you may need to restart R and rerun this code to load installed packages
# In RStudio, restart r with Session -> Restart Session

# record the R processing environment
# alternatively, use devtools::session_info() for better results
writeLines(
  capture.output(sessionInfo()),
  here("procedure", "environment", paste0("r-environment-", Sys.Date(), ".txt"))
)

# save package citations
knitr::write_bib(c(packages, "base"), file = here("software.bib"))

# set up default knitr parameters
# https://yihui.org/knitr/options/
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE, # Show outputs, but not code. Change to TRUE to show code as well
  fig.retina = 4,

: Disability Subgroup Variables

American Community Survey (ACS) data for sociodemographic subcategories of people with disabilities can be accessed by using the `tidycensus` package to query the Census API. This requires an API key which can be acquired at [api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

```{r}
acs_subject_vars <- load_variables(2018, "acs5/subject")
acs_vars_S1810 <- acs_subject_vars |> filter(str_detect(name, "S1810"))
write_csv(acs_vars_S1810, here("data", "metadata", "acs_S1810_vars.csv"))

acs_vars <- load_variables(2018, "acs5")
acs_vars_C18130 <- acs_vars |> filter(str_detect(name, "C18130"))
write_csv(acs_vars_C18130, here("data", "metadata", "acs_C18130_vars.csv"))
```


```{r API-Load-ACS, eval=FALSE}
# If you wish to use a census API key, run the census_api_key() function in the console

# Query disability demographic data with geographic boundaries
acs <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  table = "S1810",
  year = 2018,
  output = "wide",
  cache_table = TRUE,
  geometry = TRUE,
  keep_geo_vars = TRUE
)

# Query poverty and disability data
acs_pov <- get_acs(
  geography = "county",
  table = "C18130",
  year = 2018,
  output = "wide",
  cache_table = TRUE
)

# Query state geographic data
state <- get_acs(
  geography = "state",
  year = 2018,
  variables = c("B01001_001"),
  geometry = TRUE,
  keep_geo_vars = TRUE
)

# Save query results
saveRDS(acs, here("data", "raw", "public", "acs.RDS"))
saveRDS(acs_pov, here("data", "raw", "public", "acs_pov.RDS"))
saveRDS(state, here("data", "raw", "public", "state.RDS"))
```

```{r load-acs}
acs <- readRDS(here("data", "raw", "public", "acs.RDS"))
acs_pov <- readRDS(here("data", "raw", "public", "acs_pov.RDS"))
state <- readRDS(here("data", "raw", "public", "state.RDS"))
```

### ACS data transformations

The original study extent is the lower 48 states and Washington D.C. Therefore, Alaska, Hawai'i and Puerto Rico are removed from the data (workflow step 1).
Data on people with disabilities in poverty is derived from a different census table (C18130) than data on people with disabilities and age, race, ethnicity, age, and biological sex (S1810).
Therefore, join the poverty data to the other data using the GEOID (workflow step 3).
Also transform the ACS geographic data into Contiguous USA Albers Equal Area projection and fix geometry errors.

```{r filter-join-acs}
# Remove Alaska, Hawaii & Puerto Rico,
# transform coordinate system and fix geometries
acs <- filter(acs, !STATEFP %in% c("02", "15", "72")) %>%
  st_transform(5070) %>%
  st_make_valid()

# Remove Alaska, Hawaii & Puerto Rico,
state <- filter(state, !STATEFP %in% c("02", "15", "72")) %>%
  st_transform(5070)

# Join poverty data to disability data
acs <- left_join(acs, acs_pov, by = "GEOID")
rm(acs_pov)
```

Optionally, save the raw ACS data to `data/raw/public/acs.gpkg` for use in GIS software.

```{r save-ACS, message = F, eval = FALSE}
# Save downloaded acs data to acs.gpkg
st_write(
  acs,
  here("data", "derived", "public", "acs.gpkg"),
  layer = "acs"
)
st_write(
  state,
  here("data", "derived", "public", "acs.gpkg"),
  layer = "state"
)
```

Calculate independent socio-demographic variables of people with disabilities as percentages for each sub-category of disability (race, ethnicity, poverty, age, and biological sex) and remove raw census data from the data frame (workflow step 4).
Reproject the data into an Albers equal area conic projection.

```{r Preprocess-ACS}
# calculate percentages
acs_derived <- mutate(acs,
  dis_pct = S1810_C02_001E / S1810_C01_001E * 100,
  white_pct = S1810_C02_004E / S1810_C01_001E * 100,

## COVID-19 data

Data on COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard have been provided directly with the research compendium because the data is no longer available online in the state in which it was downloaded on August 1, 2020.
The dashboard and cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths were continually updated, so an exact reproduction required communication with the original author, Jayajit Chakraborty, for assistance with provision of data from August 1, 2020.
The data includes an estimate of the total population (`POP_ESTIMA`) and confirmed COVID-19 cases (`Confirmed`).
The COVID-19 case data expresses cumulative count of reported COVID-19 from 1/22/2020 to 8/1/2020.
Although metadata for this particular resource is no longer available from the original source, one can reasonably assume that the total population estimate was based on the 2014-2018 5-year ACS estimate, as the 2019 estimates data had not been released yet.

Versions of the data can be found at the John Hopkins CCSE COVID-19 Data Repository (<https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>).
However, archived data only provides summaries at the national scale.
We received the COVID-19 case data through 8/1/2020 at the county level from the author, as there is no readily apparent way to access archived data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science Engineering database.

```{r load-covid-data}
covid <- read_sf(here("data", "raw", "public", "covidcase080120.gpkg"))

# select and rename the fips code, population, cases, and x,y coordinates
covid <- select(covid,
  fips = FIPS,
  pop = POP_ESTIMA,
  cases = Confirmed,
  x = X, y = Y
)
```

### COVID-19 data transformations

Calculate the COVID incidence rate as the cases per 100,000 people (workflow step 2).
Convert the COVID data to a non-geographic data frame.

```{r covid-rate}
covid_table <- covid %>%
  mutate(covid_rate = round(covid$cases / covid$pop * 100000, 2)) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
```

Join dependent COVID data to independent ACS demographic data.

```{r join-covid-to-acs}
# Join COVID incidence rate data to acs data
acs_covid <- acs_derived %>%
  left_join(covid_table, by = "fips")

# move covid_rate column prior to disability percentages
acs_covid <- acs_covid %>%
  select(fips, statefp, county, county_st, covid_rate, everything())

rm(acs, acs_derived, covid)
```

## Missing data

**Unplanned deviation for reproduction**: There is one county with missing disability and poverty data.
This was not mentioned in the original study or in our pre-analyis plan.
However, we replace the missing data with zeros, producing results identical to Chakraborty's.

```{r missing data}
# county with missing data
filter(acs_covid, is.na(bpov_pct)) %>% st_drop_geometry() %>% kable()

# replace NA with 0 for missing data
acs_covid[is.na(acs_covid$bpov_pct), ]$bpov_pct <- 0
acs_covid[is.na(acs_covid$apov_pct), ]$apov_pct <- 0
```

# Analysis

## Descriptive statistics

Calculate descriptive statistics for dependent COVID-19 rate and independent socio-demographic characteristics, reproducing the min, max, mean, and SD columns of original study table 1.

**Planned deviation for reanalysis**: We also calculate the Shapiro Wilk test for normality.

```{r descriptive-statistics}
acs_covid_stats <- acs_covid %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  select(covid_rate, contains("pct")) %>%
  stat.desc(norm = TRUE) %>%
  round(2) %>%
  t() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  select(min, max, mean, SD = std.dev, ShapiroWilk = normtest.W, p = normtest.p)

acs_covid_stats %>%
  kable(caption = "Reproduced Descriptive Statistics",
        align = "c") %>%
  column_spec(2:6, width_min = "5em") %>%
  column_spec(7, width_min = "2em") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

Compare reproduced descriptive statistics to original descriptive statistics.
Difference is calculated as 'reproduction study - original study'.
Identical results will result in zero.

```{r compare-descriptive-stats}
# load original table 1 results
table1 <- read.csv(here("data", "raw", "public", "chakraborty", "table1.csv"))

# subtract original results from reproduced results
(select(acs_covid_stats, min, max, mean, SD) -
  select(table1, min, max, mean, SD)) %>%
  kable(caption = "Descriptive Statistics Comparison",
        align = "c") %>%
  column_spec(2:5, width = "4em") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

rm(acs_covid_stats)
```

The descriptive statistics are identical, except that the original study seems to have rounded the COVID-19 statistics to zero decimal places.

# Results

## Map of COVID-19 Rates

This map will display each US County and its rate of COVID-19 Per 100,000 people.

## Map of Disability Rates

**deviation** This map will display each US County and its percentage of people over the age of 18 with a disability.

## Table of Correlation values

This table will display correlation values using Pearson's R and Spearman's Rho, designed to reproduce Chakraborty's first table.

## Map of GEE Clusters

**deviation** This map will display each cluster as its own classification, illuminating the inner workings of GEE clustering.

## Map of Risk Scores

**deviation** This map will dispaly risk scores determined by each cluster based on COVID-19 rates, risk scores range from 1 to 6.

## Table of county weights and variance

This map will display results to reproduce Chakraborty's second table, controlling for spatial correlation using the GEE clustering.

# Discussion

Once results are found, compare table values with the table values in the original study using SATScan. Sucess will find the same values as those found in Chakrabory's original study. A failure would involve producting significantly different values, or even a study that finds a different hypothesis to be true.

# Integrity Statement

Include an integrity statement - The authors of this preregistration state that they completed this preregistration to the best of their knowledge and that no other preregistration exists pertaining to the same hypotheses and research.
If a prior registration *does* exist, explain the rationale for revising the registration here.
